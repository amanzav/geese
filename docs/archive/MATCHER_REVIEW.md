# Resume Matcher System - Review & Recommendations

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation with Recommended Changes

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The Resume Matcher System plan is **well-architected and production-ready** with a few simplifications needed for MVP. The core approach (embeddings + FAISS + LLM) is sound and cost-effective.

### ✅ What's Good
- Evidence-only LLM approach prevents hallucinations
- Local-first architecture protects privacy
- Free-tier technologies keep costs at $0
- Clear separation of concerns

### 🔧 Recommended Changes
- Simplify from 6 modules to 3 modules
- Use JSON config instead of YAML
- Support PDF resume parsing (not just .txt)
- Skip synonyms for MVP (embeddings handle it)
- Align with existing scraper data format

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### ✅ APPROVED: Keep As-Is

| Component | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Embeddings** | sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Fast, free, good quality for technical text |
| **Vector DB** | FAISS (IndexFlatIP) | Simple, fast, no dependencies |
| **LLM** | Gemini 2.0 Flash (free tier) | Best free option, supports JSON mode |
| **Evidence-Only Prompts** | Send only matched bullets to LLM | Critical for preventing hallucinations |
| **Scoring Weights** | 60% coverage, 25% skills, 15% seniority | Reasonable defaults |

---

### 🔄 MODIFIED: Simplified for MVP

#### **1. Module Structure: 6 → 3 Modules**

**Original Plan:**
```
modules/parser.py
modules/embedder.py
modules/retriever.py
modules/scorer.py
modules/llm_client.py
modules/matcher.py
```

**Recommended:**
```
modules/matcher.py         # Orchestration + scoring + resume parsing
modules/embeddings.py      # Embeddings + FAISS combined
modules/llm_client.py      # LLM only
```

**Why:** 
- Reduces complexity for MVP
- Fewer files = easier to understand
- Can refactor later if needed
- Parser/Scorer are small enough to live in matcher.py

---

#### **2. Configuration: YAML → JSON**

**Original:** `config/matcher_config.yaml`  
**Recommended:** Add to existing `config.json`

**Why:**
- Consistent with rest of project (using .env + JSON)
- No need for PyYAML dependency
- Easier for users (one config file)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "matcher": {
    "embedding_model": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "similarity_threshold": 0.65,
    "top_k": 8,
    "llm_provider": "gemini",
    "min_match_score": 70
  }
}
```

---

#### **3. Resume Format: .txt → PDF with Fallback**

**Original:** Required `input/resume.txt` (manual formatting)  
**Recommended:** Accept PDF, auto-extract, cache as .txt

**Flow:**
```
1. User places resume.pdf in input/
2. System extracts text with pypdf
3. Saves to data/resume_parsed.txt (cached)
4. If extraction fails, user can manually create .txt
```

**Why:**
- Most resumes are PDF
- Auto-extraction is more user-friendly
- Caching avoids re-parsing
- Still supports manual .txt as fallback

---

#### **4. Synonyms: Required → Optional**

**Original:** Manual `synonyms.json` required  
**Recommended:** Skip for MVP

**Why:**
- Modern embeddings handle synonyms well (e.g., "k8s" ≈ "kubernetes")
- Manual maintenance is tedious
- Can add later if similarity scores are low
- LLM can suggest synonyms dynamically

---

#### **5. Job Data Preprocessing**

**Issue:** Scraper output doesn't match matcher expectations

**Our Scraper Returns:**
```python
{
  "id", "title", "company", "division", "city",
  "summary", "responsibilities", "skills", "deadline"
}
```

**Matcher Needs:**
```python
{
  "required_bullets": [...],    # Parsed from responsibilities
  "nice_to_haves": [...],       # Parsed from skills
  "skills": [...],              # Extracted keywords
}
```

**Solution:** Add preprocessing in `matcher.py`:
```python
def _extract_jd_bullets(self, job_data):
    """Convert scraper format to matcher format"""
    bullets = []
    
    # Split responsibilities into bullets
    if job_data.get('responsibilities'):
        bullets.extend(self._split_into_bullets(job_data['responsibilities']))
    
    # Add skills as bullets
    if job_data.get('skills'):
        bullets.extend(self._split_into_bullets(job_data['skills']))
    
    return bullets
```

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Matching (Week 1)
- [ ] Create `modules/embeddings.py`
  - Load MiniLM model
  - Encode text to embeddings
  - Build FAISS index
  - Save/load index from disk

- [ ] Create `modules/matcher.py`

## 🚨 Critical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Low similarity scores** | False negatives | Tune threshold, add synonyms if needed |
| **LLM rate limits** | Slow processing | Batch with delays, fallback to Ollama |
| **Resume parsing fails** | Can't build index | Manual .txt fallback, better error messages |
| **FAISS index corruption** | System breaks | Auto-rebuild, keep backups |
| **Memory issues (large jobs)** | Crashes | Batch processing, clear cache between runs |

## ❓ Open Questions

### Before Starting Implementation:

1. **Resume Location:** Should we require user to place resume.pdf in `input/` or auto-detect in user's home directory?
   - **Recommendation:** Require `input/resume.pdf` for simplicity

2. **Batch Size:** How many jobs should we analyze before saving intermediate results?
   - **Recommendation:** Save after every 10 jobs (good balance)

3. **LLM Threshold:** At what score should we skip LLM calls to save costs?
   - **Recommendation:** Skip if fit_score < 50 (unlikely to apply anyway)

4. **Index Rebuild:** When should we auto-rebuild the resume index?
   - **Recommendation:** Detect changes to resume file (compare hash)

5. **Output Format:** Should match results be displayed in CLI or saved to JSON only?
   - **Recommendation:** Both - pretty print top 10, save all to JSON

## 📝 Notes

- The original LLM.md plan is excellent - we're just simplifying for MVP
- All core concepts remain the same (embeddings, FAISS, evidence-only LLM)
- Can always add back complexity later if needed
- Focus on getting it working first, optimize later
