## 💡 Pro Tips

### Efficient Workflow
1. **First run:** Click "Quick Scrape" to get latest jobs
2. **Filter down:** Use the 4 filters to find best matches
3. **Select wisely:** Pick 5-10 jobs per batch (faster, easier to manage)
4. **Generate first:** Always generate cover letters before uploading
5. **Upload next:** Upload letters to WaterlooWorks
6. **Apply last:** Submit applications in bulk

### Selection Strategy
- **High matches only:** Filter by "High (≥70%)" score, select all
- **Location specific:** Filter by desired location, then select
- **By company:** Use search bar for specific companies
- **Mixed approach:** Manually select across different filters

### Best Practices
- ✅ Review job details before bulk applying
- ✅ Generate in smaller batches (5-10 jobs)
- ✅ Check error messages if something fails
- ✅ Re-scrape periodically for new postings
- ✅ Use high fit score threshold for scraping (saves time)

### Common Workflows

**"Apply to everything good" approach:**
```
1. Quick Scrape (5 pages, 70% threshold)
2. Filter: Score = High
3. Select all
4. Generate Cover Letters
5. Upload to WaterlooWorks
6. Apply to All
```

**"Selective targeting" approach:**
```
1. Quick Scrape (all pages, 50% threshold)
2. Filter: Location = "Toronto" + Score = High
3. Review details, select 10 best
4. Generate Cover Letters
5. Filter: Location = "Waterloo" + Score = High
6. Select another 10
7. Generate Cover Letters (for newly selected)
8. Upload all to WaterlooWorks
9. Apply to All
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Current Limitations
1. **Simulated actions:** Dialogs currently simulate API calls
   - Shows realistic flow and timing
   - Backend integration coming soon
   - Everything is ready for real connections

2. **No persistence:** Selected jobs don't persist across refreshes
   - This is intentional for now
   - Real backend will track everything

3. **Mock data:** Stats and counts are placeholders
   - Will connect to actual database soon

### When Backend is Ready
Just these files need updating:
- `components/bulk-actions-dialog.tsx` - Add real API calls
- `components/scrape-dialog.tsx` - Add real scraping API
- `components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Connect stats to database

The UI is 100% complete and production-ready!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dev server won't start
```powershell
cd job-viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Page is blank
- Check console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Make sure `jobs_scraped.json` and `job_matches_cache.json` exist
- Refresh the page

### Filters not working
- Clear all filters and try again
- Check if any jobs match your criteria
- Try broader filters first

### Dialogs won't close
- They're designed to prevent closing during processing
- Wait for completion
- Then click "Close" or "Done"

---

## 🎉 What's Next?

### Coming Soon
1. **Real backend integration** - Connect all the dialogs to Python APIs
2. **Job detail pages** - Full view for each job with advanced analysis
3. **Cover letter management** - View, edit, and track all your letters
4. **Application tracking** - See status of all applications
5. **Settings page** - Configure filters, LLM settings, resume

### Suggestions?
The frontend is designed to be flexible and extensible. New features can be added easily!
