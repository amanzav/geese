# 🎯 Next Steps - What's Ready and What's Next

## ✅ **What You Have Now (READY TO USE!)**

### **1. Complete Job Scraping System**
- `modules/auth.py` - Logs into WaterlooWorks (Microsoft SSO + Duo 2FA)
- `modules/scraper.py` - Scrapes all job postings

### **2. AI-Powered Resume Matching**
- `modules/embeddings.py` - Converts text to semantic vectors
- `modules/matcher.py` - Scores how well jobs match your resume (0-100)
- Uses your actual resume (18 bullets from Ford, Transpire, projects)

### **3. Full Pipeline Integration**
- `main.py` - **THE MAIN SCRIPT!** 
  - Scrapes jobs from WaterlooWorks
  - Analyzes each job against your resume
  - Filters by your preferences
  - Generates reports (JSON + Markdown)
  - Shows top matches sorted by score

### **4. Testing & Configuration**
- `test_analyze.py` - Test with 8 realistic sample jobs (no scraping needed)
- `config.json` - Configure locations, keywords, companies to avoid
- All modules tested and working

---

## 🚀 **How to Use It RIGHT NOW**

### **Option 1: Test with Sample Jobs (Recommended First)**
```bash
python test_analyze.py
```
- Uses 8 pre-made sample jobs (Amazon, Shopify, Tesla, Meta, etc.)
- No login required
- Shows you how the matcher works
- Takes ~10 seconds

### **Option 2: Analyze Real WaterlooWorks Jobs**
```bash
python main.py
```
- Logs into WaterlooWorks
- Scrapes all available jobs
- Analyzes them against your resume
- Saves results to `data/matches_*.json` and `data/matches_*.md`
- Shows top 10 matches in terminal

### **Option 3: Quick Mode (Faster)**
```bash
python main.py --quick
```
- Same as above but uses "basic" scraping mode
- Faster but less job details

### **Option 4: Test Without Scraping**
```bash
python main.py --cached
```
- Uses previously scraped jobs from `data/jobs_scraped.json`
- Good for testing different filter settings

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
  "preferred_locations": ["Toronto", "Waterloo", "Remote"],
  "keywords_to_match": [],  // Empty = match all jobs
  "companies_to_avoid": [],  // Add: ["Company X", "Company Y"]
  
  "matcher": {
    "min_match_score": 30,  // Only show jobs with score >= 30
    "similarity_threshold": 0.30,  // How strict matching is (0.3 = balanced)
    "top_k": 8  // How many resume bullets to consider per requirement
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- **min_match_score**: Start with 30, increase to 50 if too many results
- **keywords_to_match**: Leave empty for all jobs, or add `["Python", "Full Stack"]`
- **companies_to_avoid**: Skip companies you don't want
